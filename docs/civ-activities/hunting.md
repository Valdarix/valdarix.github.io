## Hunting

Hunting is a legal way to make money. Currently there is one hunting zone on the map but more will be added. 

You can obtain a hunting rifle at the hunting vendor. This rifle will only work on animals and can not be used to shoot other players. This is intentional. 

You can also take on hunting missions for a little bit of an extra challenge.
