## Mining

Mining is one of the most popular activites to do in Just RP! However there are a few things to note. 

1. Your picks will expire after 90 minutes, so there is no reason to buy a bunch at once. This will just end up costing you in the long run. 
2. There is a skill check from time to time to prevent afk mining. 
3. You must smelt many of the items you get in order to sell them. 

Remember to eat and drink! Many have fallen and needed medical assitance at the smelter
