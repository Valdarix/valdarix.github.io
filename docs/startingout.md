# Starting Out

## Creating Your Character

Creating your character is the first step in your journey in Just RP! You'll need to select your character’s **gender**, **name**, and **birthdate**. Remember, your character must be at least **18 years old**. Due to CFX and Rockstar's TOS/PLA, it is against the rules to role-play as a minor. After choosing these details, you will have the chance to **customize your character's appearance**.

## Choosing Your Apartment

Once your character is created, you'll be prompted to select an **apartment**. There are several apartments to choose from, and this will be your home base in the city, complete with a **stash** for storing your items. You can return to this apartment at any time, so make sure to note its location.

> **Tip**: Sometimes the camera angle while creating your character in the apartment can be a bit awkward. If this happens, you can finalize your appearance and fix it later at the **Route 68 Plastic Surgeon**.

Once you leave your apartment, you're free to **explore the city**! You can re-enter your apartment using the menu at the front door, and even ring the bells of other residents if you'd like to pay them a visit.

## Managing Your Inventory

Your **inventory** (or "pockets") is one of the most important tools you have in the city. You can access it by pressing **Tab**. Many items in your inventory can be used by right-clicking them and selecting **Use**. The inventory system extends beyond your character—it’s also used for things like car trunks, glove boxes, and private stashes.

## Tracking Your Vitals

At the bottom left of your screen, you’ll notice several icons representing your **vitals**. Keeping an eye on these is crucial to your survival. Each vital has a different icon and can be managed in specific ways:

- **Health**: Keeping yourself alive is priority number one. Seek out medical services to heal injuries. Avoid actions that can harm you.
- **Hunger**: Over time, your hunger will increase. You’ll need to eat food to keep this meter up.
- **Thirst**: Just like hunger, thirst builds up over time. Drinking beverages will help maintain your thirst meter.
- **Stress**: Activities like reckless driving or gunfire can increase your stress level. High stress affects your vision and motor skills, but there are ways to reduce it.
- **Stamina**: Running reduces your stamina. Initially, your stamina is low, but the more you run, the longer you'll be able to run over time as this skill improves.
- **Breath**: Swimming or diving consumes your breath. Make sure you surface before running out of air. This skill also improves as you dive more.

## Shops Around the City

The city is filled with **shops** that sell a wide variety of items. Explore different shops to see what they have to offer, as each one may stock different types of goods. Remember, many shops have multiple **tabs** in their menu, so if you don’t find what you're looking for on the first tab, check the others before leaving!

## Clothing Stores

Wearing the same outfit for too long can get... well, a little stinky. **Clothing stores** around the city allow you to purchase fresh outfits and even save your favorites for quick access later.

> **Note**: From time to time, the city may add new clothing, hairstyles, or other customization options. This can occasionally cause your character's appearance to change temporarily. We will do our best to notify you in advance when this happens.
