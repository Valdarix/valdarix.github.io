# EMS Overview

Being an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provider is one of the most important, yet often overlooked, cornerstones of a good roleplay server. EMS personnel are crucial for ensuring that citizens receive the care they need during emergencies, accidents, and other high-stress situations. As an EMS, you will be responsible for responding to medical calls, treating injuries, and transporting patients to safety, all while maintaining a calm and professional demeanor. The role not only enhances the realism of the server, but also contributes to the overall flow of roleplay by allowing players to recover and continue their stories.

In Just RP, all EMS staff operate under the same job rank and structure. However, there are **three distinct hospitals** in the city where EMS can operate from:

- **Pillbox Medical Center**
- **Route 68 Medical**
- **Paleto Bay Medical**

Each hospital has its own unique ambulance, giving EMS personnel the flexibility to respond from any location. Whether you're stationed in the city or in more rural areas, youâ€™ll have the tools you need to provide essential medical services. 

Additionally, our **Detectives** are trained to perform emergency medical services when needed, ensuring there is always a quick response to medical calls. When no EMS or detectives are available, players can rely on our **AI Medic**, who can be summoned to assist in emergencies.

EMS play a vital role in the overall health and well-being of our city, and we encourage those looking for an important and rewarding role to consider joining this essential service.
