## How to do the job

Working as an EMS can be a fun and rewarding roleplay experience. However, using the job tools can be a little confusing at first. This guide has been made as a resource to help alleviate some of that stress. 

### Tools of the Job

The EMS job requires a medical bag with supplies to heal and revive players. You can locate an EMS armory where you can grab your medical bag and a few other supplies in any of the 3 hospitals around the map. Once you have your medical bag you can visit the refill station in the hospitals to refill the items in your bag. 

When you arrive on scene you can open your inventory and use your medical bag to place it in your hands. Press **E** to drop the bag on the ground near you to grab the supplies from the bag needed to heal the player. 

You can use **third eye** or your **F6** menu to view the patient's injuries, heal or revive them. 

You can also invoice the player with your third eye. 

Your F6 menu also has the ability to toggle self-check-in on/off at any of the hospitals in the city in real-time without needing a script restart. 

Finally, you can use your F6 menu to force the player to walk for a given period of time, this should be used when a player has been severely injured.
