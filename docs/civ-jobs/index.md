# Civilian Jobs

We understand that not everyone wants to work at a whitelist business and just want to have ways to make a little bit of cash using scripted/NPC jobs. For that reason we have several civiilian jobs available. While some jobs require you to get a job at city hall, others allow you to work freelance, meaning you can just go up to the starting location of the job and start making money. Select each jobs specific page to find out more about the job.
