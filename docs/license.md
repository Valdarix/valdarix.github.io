# Licenses

There are several types of licenses available in the city. Having the appropriate licenses will help keep you on the right side of the law.

## Driver's License

You will automatically have a **driver's license** in your inventory when you arrive in town. If you happen to lose it, you can easily obtain a new one by visiting **City Hall**.

## Hunting License

A **hunting license** can be purchased at the **Sandy Shores City Hall**. You must have this license with you while hunting. If you are caught hunting without a valid license, you could face legal consequences.

## Fishing License

A **fishing license** is also available for purchase at the **Sandy Shores City Hall**. It is required while fishing, and getting caught fishing without one could lead to trouble with the law.

## Weapon License

A **weapon license** is required to purchase firearms from **Ammunation**. To obtain a weapon license, you must find a police officer who can issue one to you. Note that you must have a **clean criminal record** to qualify for a weapon license. Possessing a firearm without a valid license is against the law and could result in serious penalties.
