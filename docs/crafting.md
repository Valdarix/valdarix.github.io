## Crafting

Crafting is an important skill to have in the city. A good crafter is needed in any group. Spending time crafting will enhance what you have the ability to make. 

There are 3 crafting benches in the city - along with 4 types of crafting. 

### Materials
Materials are the base, low level items needed to craft other items. You can craft materials at any crafting bench found in the city. 

### Misc. 
Misc. items are tools you might need for criminal activity or protection. Examples are advanced lockppicks and body armor.

### Electronics 
The electronics crafting bench is used to create items that allow you to hack, crack, etc. 

### Weapons
Most guns in the city have to be crafted. These guns require a higher crafting level and a blueprint (that is consumed upon use). Wee have selected this method of obtaining guns in order to make them harder to obtain and give them more value. 


NOTE: Items will be added to the crafting benches from time to time.
