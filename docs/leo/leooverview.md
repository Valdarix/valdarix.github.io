Serving as a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) in a roleplay city is a unique and highly rewarding experience that comes with significant responsibility. LEOs are entrusted with maintaining law and order, ensuring the safety of all citizens, and upholding the city's standards of roleplay. **Integrity** is paramount in this role, as officers are expected to handle situations fairly, with a strong commitment to realism and respect for the roleplay environment. High expectations are set for those in law enforcement positions, as their actions directly impact the experiences of others within the city. Officers must be able to make sound decisions under pressure, communicate effectively, and work collaboratively with fellow officers and the community.

In Just RP, players have the opportunity to serve in one of three distinct law enforcement departments. Currently, the **Los Santos Police Department (LSPD)** is active, providing urban law enforcement across the bustling city. Soon, players will also be able to join the **Blaine County Sheriff's Office (BCSO)** and the **San Andreas Highway Patrol (SAHP)**, expanding the reach of law enforcement to more rural areas and highways. Each department offers unique challenges and opportunities, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in different aspects of law enforcement. Regardless of the department, serving as an LEO in Just RP requires dedication, integrity, and a strong sense of responsibility to maintain the high standards expected of all officers.
