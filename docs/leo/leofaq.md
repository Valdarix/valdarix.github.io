# FAQ

## Why don't we use Sonoran CAD?

Sonoran Cad, while immersive, is just too much to ask of players for a community that is not primarly focused on LEO. Sometimes there is such a thing as too much immersion and being too realistic. It is also pretty common that players on FiveM don't always have the best PC and/or internet connection and asking people who are not always the most technologically versed puts alot of strain on their setups and on our staff to support them. 

## Why don't we use LVC Sirens?

We know people love LVC. It has lot's of siren options, plugins and other bells and whistles, but we have all been in scenes with multiple cop cars around and heard players yelling "turn off the sirens, they are giving me headaches!" The truth is LVC is just poorly coded and unmaintained at this point. We have elected to use Renewed Siren Sync, while it does not have a bunch of siren options it provides great syncing with almost no performance tradeoff. 

## Code3/Redneck Mods/Other Car Developer Does great police cars, why don't we use them. 

Yes, Code3, Redneck and a few other developers out there do make some great car models. However, we strive to remain TOS compliant. That means two things. First the cars must be sold on Tebex and second, they must be GTA Lore friendly, this means the simple debadging done by creators like Redneck and some of the developers on Code3 are not compliant. This makes them a waste of money in the long run. For this reason we stick to VD Customs and Noisiak for our ememrgency vehicles.
