# Gangs in Just RP

Gangs are a vital part of our city's role-play environment, and certain exceptions are made for them regarding scene limits. However, to maintain their status, gangs must adhere to specific rules and meet established criteria that is defined in the **Gang RP** section of [Just RP Rulebook](https://justrp.cloud/rules.html)

> **Note:** Gang applications are currently closed. When they open, an announcement will be made in Discord with the steps needed to apply.

To ensure compliance with TOS, our city features in-city gangs, each with their own lore, designated territories, and colors. This approach helps maintain a structured and immersive role-play experience while adhering to the necessary guidelines.

For more detailed information, please refer to the **Gang Information** channel in our Discord.
