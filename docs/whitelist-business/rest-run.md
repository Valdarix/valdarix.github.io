# New Business Owner Guide

Welcome, New Business Owner! This guide is designed to help you get started and better understand your custom boss menu.

## Opening the Boss Menu

To begin, locate and access your boss menu by **third-eyeing** your designated location inside your business. Once opened, you will see several vital options designed to help you manage key aspects of your business.

### 1. Management Section / Employee Management

This section allows you to view your current employees, add new hires, or remove team members.

- To hire new employees, they must be present and standing near you to be hired.
- Once an employee is hired, you will have the option to **promote**, **demote**, or **fire** them.

### 2. Recipes

The **Recipes** section in your boss menu allows you to create custom items to sell in your business. These items can range from food and drinks to other products relevant to your business. The recipe creation process is simple yet highly customizable, ensuring you can offer unique products to your customers.

#### How to Create a Recipe

- Left-click on the **Recipes** option in your boss menu. This will open a new section dedicated to building your custom recipe.

#### Entering Recipe Details

Once in the recipe creation section, fill out the following fields to complete your new item:

- **Item Name**: Enter a catchy, easy-to-remember name for your item.
- **Description**: Provide a brief (up to 225 characters) description that captures the essence of the item.
- **Image**: Upload an image of what the item will look like. This visual element enhances customer appeal.
- **Eating/Drinking Animation**: Choose a consumable animation if applicable, adding immersion to the customer experience.
- **Type of Item**: Select whether it's a food item, beverage, or something else to categorize it for inventory and sales tracking.
- **Station Assignment**: Choose the station (e.g., Grill, Drink Machine) where the item will be made.
- **Price**: Set the price for the item, balancing ingredient costs and profitability.

#### Selecting Ingredients

Choose up to **six ingredients** per item. While you can use fewer ingredients, more complex items offer greater benefits. Ensure the ingredients make sense for the item you're creating.

> **Tip**: For example, a black coffee only needs water and coffee beans, while a specialty latte might require espresso, milk, flavoring syrup, and whipped cream, offering a premium item with a higher price.

Once you’ve completed these steps, save the recipe to begin using it. Creativity and practicality should go hand-in-hand when creating new items.

### 3. Menu Image

The **Menu Image** section allows you to add a visual representation of your business's menu that customers can keep in their inventory. This feature makes it easy for customers to access your offerings, complete with descriptions, images, and prices.

#### How to Add a Menu Image

- Click on the **Menu Image** option from your boss menu.
- Paste the URL of your menu image in the provided field.

### 4. Offline Shop

The **Offline Shop** feature allows you to continue selling items even when you or your employees are not online. This ensures your business can generate revenue 24/7, providing a seamless shopping experience for your customers.

#### How the Offline Shop Works

The Offline Shop is managed by an NPC (Non-Player Character) when no one from your business is available. The NPC handles customer transactions, so your business remains operational even when you're offline.

#### Setting Up the Offline Shop

- **Access the Offline Shop**: Navigate to the **Offline Shop** option from the boss menu. This will open the setup panel where you can add or remove items for sale.
- **Exclusive Access**: As the business owner, only you can add or remove items from the offline shop's inventory. Employees do not have access to manage the offline shop.
- **Select Items for Sale**: From the list of items you currently sell, choose which ones to offer in the offline shop.
- **Manage Inventory**: Ensure you stock enough items to meet demand while you’re away. If an item sells out, the NPC won’t be able to offer it until you restock.

By managing these aspects effectively, your business will thrive both while you're online and offline.
