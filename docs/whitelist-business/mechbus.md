# Mech Shops

[![Showcase Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Zvxozmq3huc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvxozmq3huc)

Our mechanic shops use one of the best mechanic scripts in FiveM. You can click the video above to watch an overview of how it works. 

Our mech shop also offers a replacement script for Benny's Customs providing a uniformed experience. 

## **I did an engine swap, why is my vehicle slower?**

The script is not broken, this functionality modifies the vehicle's handling file, and some vehicles can have wildly different handling files. The default configured handling changes, therefore, don't work well on all vehicles. They have been specifically tuned for the vanilla GTA vehicles.

This typically happens with addon vehicles, when their handling file is unbalanced. By default, our engine swaps overwrite certain handling values (see below). If some of the values modified as part of the swap were set too high in the vehicle's base handling file to compensate for other values that were set improperly, this can actually make your vehicle slower.
