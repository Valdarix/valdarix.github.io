## Types of Whitelist Businesses

### Restaurants and Bars
These establishments use a robust script that allows players who work there to create custom recipes and items for others to consume. Restaurants and bars provide a full role-play experience and include an offline shop feature, enabling businesses to make sales even when employees are not available.

### Mechanic Shops
Player-owned mechanic shops offer services to enhance vehicles with upgrades such as improved engines, transmissions, and more. These businesses allow players to role-play as mechanics and serve the needs of the city's car enthusiasts.

### Other Services
In addition to restaurants and mechanics, some businesses provide unique services to the citizens of the city. These could include shops, entertainment venues, or any other role-play business that enriches the city experience.

## Future Business Opportunities

In the future, we may enable player-owned car and bike dealerships, adding even more opportunities for players to own and operate their own businesses.
