# Images

Our restaurant script allows you to create your own custom recipes. This means that you have full power over the item created for the players in the city. Because of that, you are responsible for creating the images that you will be using in the recipe creator. These images need to be **96 px x 96 px** and should be of good quality. You will need to submit your images for approval before you use them in the city.

The images you will need for your business are

- Final Product image (all ingredients already have an image) - This is the image players will see of your final prepared recipe item. It is what they will consume.
- Menu Image - This image will be an image players can use to see your full menu.

## Creating Images
Creating Images can be done a few different ways. It is up to you to determine the best route for you. 

1. Use a service like Canva to create your menu images. 
2. Use something like Midjourney or Bing Image creator. 
3. Google for images that suit your needs that are not of name-brand products.

## Hosting Images
Our script requires that your images be hosted on [Fivemanage](https://fivemanage.com). You can setup a free Fivemanage account to host your images or you can submit the images to us for hosting. If you wish to host your own Fivemanage images you can read more about that here [Setup Fivemanage](https://valdarix.github.io/docs/whitelist-business/rest-img-fivemanage.html).
