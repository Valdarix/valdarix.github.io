# Drugs

### Drug Types

We currently have **four types of drugs** available in the city. Our drug system is custom-built and constantly evolving, so it's important to check back here for updates.

- **Weed**
- **Coke**
- **Crack**
- **Meth**

More drugs may be added over time as the script develops.

### Finding Drug Locations

Hints and keys to drug locations can be found while participating in other activities around the city. Keep your eyes open for clues.

### Drug Gathering

To gather the items needed for drug processing, you'll use the **third-eye feature**. Each drug requires different items for processing, so make sure you're collecting the correct ingredients depending on the drug you're working with.

### Drug Processing

Once you’ve found the processing location and have the key, you can begin processing the drug. You won’t need to memorize any recipes! The processing location will tell you the maximum amount of the drug you can produce at that time. **The only ingredient we will tell you that you need are Empty Baggies that you can purchase from any hardware store.**

> **Note:** Some drugs may share ingredients, so keep an eye on your inventory to track what’s being used.

### Drug Selling

Currently, the only way to sell drugs is through **civilian selling** using the third-eye feature. However, more selling methods will be added in the future as we expand the system.
