# Introduction

Welcome to the heart of Just RP! In this section, you will find a wealth of general information designed to help you navigate and thrive in our city. Whether you're new to GTARP/FiveM or a seasoned player, this guide is here to help you understand the core aspects of daily life in Just RP.

We encourage you to explore each section carefully to become familiar with how things work. From basic mechanics to more in-depth systems, this documentation will equip you with the knowledge to make the most of your roleplay experience.

Take your time, dive into the details, and get ready to immerse yourself in the city fully!

Remember that RP is meant to be an escape. It is not real life and nothing in the city is serious. Roll with the RP, you won't win every situation and many times the most memorable scenes can be from the losing perspective. Enjoy yourself, tell your story, and remember there are no main characters.
